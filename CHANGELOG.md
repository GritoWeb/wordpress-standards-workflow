# Changelog

Notable changes to the GritoWeb WordPress standards.

## 2026-05-20

### Changed
- `EXAMPLES.md` rewritten around the canonical team layout:
  - `app/Blocks/BlockManager.php` owns the manual blocks list, global
    attributes (padding presets), and a `$libs` registry that registers
    vendored libs once and enqueues them per block via `render_block` —
    no global loads.
  - Block folder is `resources/blocks/<slug>/` with files literally named
    `block.json`, `block.php`, `block.jsx`, `block.js`, `block.css`.
  - `block.json` uses `"render": "file:./block.php"`; no `render_callback`
    is passed to `register_block_type`. `block.php` shapes data and calls
    `\Roots\view('blocks.<slug>', $data)->render()`.
  - Local block assets (`block.js`, `block.css`) are discovered by
    `vite.config.js` (`discoverBlockAssets()`); no `viewScript`/`style`
    keys in `block.json`.
  - Vendor libs live in `resources/{js,css}/vendor/` as pre-built
    distributables and are served directly via `get_theme_file_uri()` —
    not shipped through the Vite build.

### Added
- `README.md` — the start-a-project workflow (Pantheon + local-only) and how
  to consume this repo.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the dev standard (seeded verbatim from the team good-practices
  gist). This repo is now the source of truth.
- `skills/html-qa-smoketest/SKILL.md` — authoritative QA skill (table-based
  checklist with per-item severity).
- `EXAMPLES.md` — one complete reference block (code in fenced blocks)
  showing the `CLAUDE.md` rules composed in context, for AI grounding.
- `gitignore.example` — base ignore rules for WP + Sage 11 + Lando.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` › Critical Rules: added "never make assumptions — ask when
  unsure" and "don't just agree — push back on flawed requests".
- `CLAUDE.md` › Critical Rules: replaced the generic "never push a database to
  production" with "never alter anything in production/remote without explicit
  request" (read-only remote commands free; writes and `lando pull` gated).
  PR checklist line aligned.

### Notes
- Standards source of truth moved from the gists to this repo.
- Dropped the earlier automation script approach in favor of a plain
  documentation/reference repo (the bring-up is interactive anyway).
